In writing many of the codes in this repository, we used as references the sample codes distributed with the book 『プログラミング言語大全』(Encyclopedia of Programming Languages) by kujirahand.com. Although no explicit license information is included in the sample codes, we directly made contact with the author to confirm they are distributed under the MIT license. Taking this into account, we apply the MIT License to this repository as a whole.
